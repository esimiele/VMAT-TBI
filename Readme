updated on 11-12-2021

NEW:
Added example patient scans and structures sets for testing. One VMAT-only case and one VMAT with AP/PA case are provided.

Latest release code versions:
Plug-in --> v1.5
Executable --> v1.0

Updates to both scripts from v1.4/v0.9 (i.e., pre- 8/12/2021):
-Fixed minor bugs and GUI formatting issues in both codes
-Added code to allow the user to specify default settings in both scripts in a .ini configuration file (see the VMAT_TBI_config.ini example provided with the code)
-Both scripts will look for this file (in the directory that the script was called from) upon execution
-The default options for both scripts can be set in this .ini file to reduce the number of times an end-user needs to make changes to the underlying code and recompile
-Both GUI's have been updated to include a new tab to show the current configuration settings
-Please see Section 7 of the 'VMAT_TBI_guide.pdf' file for more details on how to setup and use the configuration file

ESAPI/Projects/VMATTBIautoPlan --> binary plug in
ESAPI_MT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT --> stand-alone executable

Some important notes to make the scripts run:
binary plug-in:
-for the most part, this script is pretty self-contained
-the main parameters that can be adjusted are the global variables noted at the beginning of the UI class (UI.xaml.cs file)
-if you want to adjust the default energy for the static AP/PA beams, you need to adjust the beam energy specifier used in assigning ebmpStatic 
(two total instances of "6X" in the constructors for the class)

stand-alone executable:
-most of the global variables are listed in the header for the MainWindow class (indicated near the top)
-If you want to use/not use jaw tracking or the normal tissue objective (NTO) in the optimization, modify the values for the plan.OptimizationSetup.UseJawTracking and 
plan.OptimizationSetup.AddAutomaticNormalTissueObjective variables near the bottom of the preliminaryChecks method in the optimizationLoop class

Please see the VMAT_TBI_install_and_run_guide.pdf file to help you get up and running quickly. Note, we are currently working on including example VMAT TBI patient CT 
scans and structure sets (anonymized) in the code distribution.
Stay tuned.
